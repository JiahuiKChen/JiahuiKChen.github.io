# About Me  

I graduated in May 2020 with a Computer Science B.S. and minors in Math and Cognitive Science.  
I'm interested in the intersection of AI and neuroscience/cognitive science
and am planning on eventually pursuing a Computer Science Ph.D.  
<br/>
I enjoy the outdoors and exercise, music and playing violin, community engagement, food, and houseplants. I also occasionally [write](https://medium.com/@jiahui.k.chen).
