<br>
Hey there!
<br>
<br>
I just graduated (May 2020) from the University of Utah.
<br>
As an undergraduate, I interned for Microsoft and Instagram/Facebook doing applied Machine Learning
work and published research in virtualization and ML applied to computer networking
(see my <a href="https://jiahuikchen.github.io/resume/">technical resume and curriculum vitae</a> for more details).
<br>
<br>
I'll be working at Facebook as a software engineer starting June 2020.
