Hey there!
<br>
I'm a PhD student at UT Austin, advised by Amy Zhang, and a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/"> NSF CSGrad4US Fellow </a>. 
<br>
I'm interested in the controllability of generative AI and AI robustness via uncertainty quantification. 
<br>
<br>
Previously I was a software engineer at Meta working on their first Generative AI product: 
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892231/meta-generative-ai-image-editing-stickers-instagram-facebook-whatsapp"> AI-generated stickers </a>. 
<br>
Before that I worked on uncertainty quantification in deep learning and Bayesian modeling at Facebook Research.
