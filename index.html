<br>
Hey there!
<br>
<br>
I'm a rising senior at the University of Utah. 
<br>
<br>
I've interned for Microsoft and Instagram/Facebook as a Software Engineering Intern doing Machine Learning/Data Science work 
(check out my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jiahui-k-chen/">LinkedIn</a> and/or 
<a href="https://jiahuikchen.github.io/resume/">resume</a> for more details). 
<br>
<br>
I also work on research in Virtualization (*add link to SLATE*) and am working on my undergraduate thesis on applying machine learning 
to newtork security.
