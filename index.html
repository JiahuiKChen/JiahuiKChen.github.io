Hey there!
<br>
<br>
I currently work as a software engineer at Meta, my research topics include uncertainty quantification in deep learning, 
Bayesian modeling, and improving robustness in machine learning.
<br>
Previously, I interned for Microsoft and Instagram/Meta doing applied machine learning
work; I also published research in virtualization and machine learning applied to computer systems.
See my <a href="https://jiahuikchen.github.io/resume/">resume and curriculum vitae</a> for more details.
