Hey there!
<br>
<br>
I graduated in May 2020 with a Computer Science B.S. and minors in Math and Cognitive Science.
<br>
As an undergraduate, I interned for Microsoft and Instagram/Facebook doing applied Machine Learning
work; I also published research in virtualization and applied Machine Learning.
<br>
See my <a href="https://jiahuikchen.github.io/resume/">technical resume and curriculum vitae</a> for more details.
<br>
<br>
I'm currently working at Facebook as a Software Engineer.
